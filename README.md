# Fetch ML Assessment

## Overview
This project contains solutions for the Fetch ML Assessment, covering:
- Task 1: Sentence Transformer implementation using BERT.
- **Task 2:** Multi-Task Learning with Sentence Classification & Sentiment Analysis.
- **Task 3:** Training considerations, freezing strategies, and transfer learning.
- **Task 4:** Training loop implementation for the multi-task model.

All solutions are implemented in Jupyter notebooks with clean, structured code.

## 📂 Files and Folders
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for each task.
- `models/` → Python scripts for model implementation.
- `docs/` → Additional write-ups (Task 3 explanation).
- `requirements.txt` → List of dependencies.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd fetch-ml-assessment
   ```

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Jupyter Notebooks:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📑 Task Breakdown
- **Task 1:** Implemented a Sentence Transformer using BERT.  
- **Task 2:** Expanded to Multi-Task Learning with two classification heads.  
- **Task 3:** Discussed training strategies and transfer learning.  
- **Task 4:** Created a structured training loop for the multi-task model.  

## 📝 Final Notes
- Code follows **PEP 8 guidelines**.
- Notebooks are **well-structured and modular**.
- Models are designed for **scalability and future improvements**.

        "- **What It Means:** All parameters are fixed, and no part of the network is updated during training.\n",
        "- **Pros:**  \n",
        "  - Prevents overfitting on very small datasets.\n",
        "  - Reduces training time since only any additional layers (if present) are updated.\n",
        "- **Cons:**  \n",
        "  - No task-specific adaptation occurs, which may limit performance if the downstream task differs significantly from the pre-training tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Freezing Only the Transformer Backbone:**  \n",
        "- **What It Means:** The shared encoder (BERT-based SentenceTransformer) is kept fixed, while the task-specific heads are fine-tuned.\n",
        "- **Pros:**  \n",
        "  - Retains robust, pre-trained language representations.\n",
        "  - Allows the task-specific heads to adapt to the particular requirements of each task.\n",
        "- **Cons:**  \n",
        "  - The fixed backbone may not fully adjust to domain-specific nuances, potentially limiting performance improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Freezing One Task-Specific Head:**  \n",
        "- **What It Means:** One of the task-specific heads is kept fixed while the shared encoder and the other head are fine-tuned.\n",
        "- **Pros:**  \n",
        "  - Useful when one task has already achieved acceptable performance or has abundant data.\n",
        "  - Focuses learning on the more challenging or less established task.\n",
        "- **Cons:**  \n",
        "  - May lead to imbalance if the fixed head prevents the shared encoder from fully adapting to both tasks.\n",

        "1. **Pre-trained Model Choice:**  \n",
        "   - Use a robust pre-trained model such as `bert-base-uncased`, which has demonstrated strong performance across various NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Layer Freezing Strategy:**  \n",
        "   - **Initial Phase:** Freeze most of the transformer layers (except for the task-specific heads and possibly the top one or two layers of the backbone). This leverages the strong pre-trained features and minimizes overfitting on limited data.\n",
        "   - **Gradual Unfreezing:** Once the task-specific heads stabilize, gradually unfreeze additional layers of the backbone to allow for fine-tuning to the new task domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Rationale:**  \n",
        "   - This strategy balances stability and adaptability. Freezing most layers initially ensures that the model retains its pre-trained knowledge, while gradually unfreezing allows the model to adapt to the specifics of the new tasks as more task-specific data becomes available.\n",
